<!-- This is a layout page. 

To have a page use this layout, 
set layout: default as a variable in the page's front matter. 

A layout page can contain reusable code, like headers,
footers, and navigation code.

<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>About</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Notes:
1. Notice how _includes files do not have front matter.
2. _includes files are usually small content bits we can reuse.
Whereas layouts have more to do with the overall layout of the page.

The permalink is not the best way to go about it.
We should maintain a _config file for all the permalinks.
