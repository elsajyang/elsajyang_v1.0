<!-- This is a layout page. 

To have a page use this layout, 
set layout: default as a variable in the page's front matter. 

A layout page can contain reusable code, like headers,
footers, and navigation code.

<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Creating Githubio</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Notes:
1. Notice how _includes files do not have front matter.
2. _includes files are usually small content bits we can reuse.
Whereas layouts have more to do with the overall layout of the page.

Jekyll: "post.html" exemplifies layout inheritance. The post 
layout outputs the title, date, author and content body,
 which is wrapped by the default layout.
